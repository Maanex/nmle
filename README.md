**Node Modules License Exporter** is a commandline tool to export licenses of node modules quickly and relieably. By default it exports to a huge Markdown file but that can be changed by modding `exporter.js`.

## Usage:

`node . --path <path to project root>`

Optional parameters:
```
--out <path to output file; if none defined will print to console>
```
